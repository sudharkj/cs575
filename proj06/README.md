Solution to [Project #6](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs575/Projects/proj06.html) 
(OpenCL Array Multiply, Multiply-Add, and Multiply-Reduce).

In this project element-wise product is computed using OpenCL and the simulation is explained with the help of graphs. 
The report documents this attempt when run on a GPU.
