## CUDA Monte Carlo

Solution to [Project #5](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs575/Projects/proj05.html) 
(Vectorized Array Multiplication/Reduction using SSE).

Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the range of outcomes for a series of parameters. 
In this project Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to determine the probability of a beam hitting a circular plate 
when it is randomly changing location and size. The report documents this attempt when run on CUDA.
