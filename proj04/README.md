## Vectorized Array Multiplication/Reduction using SSE

Solution to [Project #4](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs575/Projects/proj04.html) 
(Vectorized Array Multiplication/Reduction using SSE).

This report documents an attempt to test array multiplication/reduction using SIMD and non-SIMD. 
First a simple comparison between SIMD and non-SIMD is presented without using multicore environment. 
Later, speedups are compared in multicore environments.

Other details can be found in parent [README.md](https://github.com/sudharkj/cs575/blob/master/README.md)
